ku-acm-competition-2013
=======================

You came, you saw, you conquered.

The problem set is up in .ps and .pdf; the pdf file doesn't embed the fonts, so some elements may flow differently. The PostScript file is the reference file.

More coming soon, including reference inputs and outputs, sample problem solutions, and some special sections (e.g. on handling stdin effectively in an Eclipse Java project, analyses of particularly awesome/interesting submissions).
